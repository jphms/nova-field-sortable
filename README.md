This is a fork with fixes of an abandoned (?) package.
Feel free to submit issues or PRs

## Installation

This package isn't on Packagist, so to get started, add it as a repository to your composer.json file:
```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/jphms/nova-field-sortable"
    }
]
```
Next, run this command to add the preset to your project:

```bash
composer require jphms/nova-field-sortable --dev
```
